	  <h1>Enhancing Product Description with LLM-Driven Structured Insights</h1>

	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p> In the digital marketplace, sellers strive to enhance product descriptions to boost sales, while customers look for reliable information. E-commerce platforms rely on accurate product descriptions, but these often fall short in completeness or accuracy. Customer reviews can help fill these gaps. To help with making product reviews better, we introduce <strong>PRAISE: </strong> <strong>P</strong>raise <strong>R</strong>eview <strong>A</strong>ttribute <strong>I</strong>nsight <strong>S</strong>tructuring <strong>E</strong>nging. Our tool, PRAISE, utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically summarize and assess both product descriptions and customer reviews through a single, intuitive interface. By integrating these sources, PRAISE enhances the clarity and persuasiveness of product descriptions in a structured format. Our research demonstrates that LLMs significantly improve product descriptions by incorporating insights from customer reviews, offering a notable advancement over existing approaches. PRAISE is available as a web application and can be accessed <a href="https://praise-demo.streamlit.app/">here</a>.</p>
