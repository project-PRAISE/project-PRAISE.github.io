      <h1>Enhancing Product Description with LLM-Driven Structured Insights</h1>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        In the competitive landscape of online retail, accurate and comprehensive product descriptions are crucial for both sellers and customers.  While e-commerce platforms strive to provide detailed information, product descriptions often lack completeness or accuracy. Customer reviews can bridge this gap, but navigating a plethora of unstructured feedback can be challenging. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To address this issue, we introduce <strong>PRAISE: Product Review Attribute Insight Structuring Engine</strong>. This innovative tool leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically analyze and synthesize product descriptions and customer reviews within a single, user-friendly interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        By integrating these diverse data sources, PRAISE empowers both sellers and customers with a more comprehensive understanding of products, leading to improved decision-making and increased customer satisfaction.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        We introduce PRAISE, a novel tool designed to improve the clarity and informativeness of product descriptions by leveraging insights derived from customer reviews.  PRAISE employs a hybrid approach, combining the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a rule-based methodology to effectively synthesize information from both product descriptions and customer feedback. The core functionality of PRAISE can be broken down into these key steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Extracting Descriptive Details from Reviews:</strong> We employ an LLM to identify and extract important descriptive details about the product from each individual customer review. We also filter out opinions or irrelevant information in this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Comparison of Reviews with Seller Description and Categorization:</strong> We use an LLM to compare the descriptive details with the seller description to find information that is Matching, Partially Matching, Contradictory, Missing or an Opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Merging Tables for Relevant Categories:</strong> We use a rule based method to get tables for Missing, Contradictory and Partially Matching information as those are the most important categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: Grouping of Similar Attributes:</strong> To further refine the organization of information, similar attributes are grouped together using an LLM. This step ensures that related features are presented cohesively.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: Creating Final Tables with Categories:</strong> The final step uses another rule based methodology to enable the creation of comprehensive tables that present the synthesized information in a clear and organized manner.</li>
      </ul>
